# portfolio-app
Frontend React application. 
Featuring hooks, routing, lazy loading, listeners, Framer and Tensorflow.js.
I tried to keep it short to make browsing through the code less time consuming.

##Disclaimer
gh-pages doesn't fully support BrowserRouter so refreshing routes other then the main one will cause an error.
There's no such error when launching the app using node.
It could be fixed using HashRouter but according to my knowledge it's obsolete so I decided against using it.
